Hyperparameter Search for CNN and RNN Models
Objective
The objective of this project is to implement a hyperparameter search for both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) using the Random Search technique. This will allow us to optimize hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of layers, batch size, and more to find the best configuration for both models.

Hyperparameters to Search Over
The following hyperparameters will be included in the search space:

Learning Rate: Varying between values like 0.001, 0.01, 0.1

Number of Layers: Vary between different numbers (e.g., 2, 3, 4 for CNN and RNN)

Number of Neurons/Filters: Neurons for RNNs, Filters for CNNs (e.g., 32, 64, 128)

Batch Size: Experiment with different batch sizes (e.g., 32, 64, 128)

Optimizer: Options such as Adam, SGD, and RMSprop

Activation Functions: Test ReLU, Tanh, and Sigmoid

Dropout Rate: Vary dropout rates (e.g., 0.2, 0.5)

Kernel Size: Specific to CNN models (e.g., (3,3), (5,5))

Stride: Specific to CNN models (e.g., 1, 2)

Weight Initialization Method: Xavier, He Normal

Random Search
We will utilize RandomizedSearchCV from Scikit-Learn or a custom random sampling method to search through these hyperparameters. Multiple models will be trained with different hyperparameter combinations, and we will select the best-performing configuration based on validation accuracy.

Model Implementation
1. CNN Model
Layers: Convolutional, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense

Optimizers: Adam, SGD, RMSprop

Activations: ReLU, Sigmoid

Dropout Rate: Added after dense layers to prevent overfitting

Other Parameters: Vary kernel size, stride, and weight initialization methods.

2. RNN Model
Layers: Custom RNN cells (no LSTMs/GRUs), Dense layers

Optimizers: Adam, SGD, RMSprop

Activations: ReLU, Tanh

Dropout Rate: Added after dense layers

Other Parameters: Number of neurons, batch size, etc.

Steps to Implement
1. Hyperparameter Space Definition
Define the set of hyperparameters and their values for both CNN and RNN models. This will form the search space for the Random Search.

2. Random Search for Hyperparameters
Use RandomizedSearchCV (from Scikit-Learn) or implement a custom random sampling approach to randomly search through the hyperparameter space.

3. Model Training
CNN: Train CNN models with different combinations of hyperparameters.

RNN: Train RNN models with different combinations of hyperparameters.

Both models will be trained using the training set and validated on the validation set.

4. Evaluation
Evaluate each configuration on the test dataset and compare the performance in terms of:

Validation Accuracy

Test Accuracy

5. Compare Performance
Once the best configurations for both models are found, compare their test performance (e.g., accuracy, loss) and visualize the results.

Expected Output
1. Comparison Table
You will produce a table that compares the performance of the best-performing CNN and RNN models, including their hyperparameters and test accuracy:


Model	Hyperparameters	Test Accuracy	Validation Accuracy
CNN	[Hyperparameter Values]	[Value]	[Value]
RNN	[Hyperparameter Values]	[Value]	[Value]
2. Performance Metrics Visualization
Plot training and validation accuracy curves for the best CNN and RNN models.

3. Hyperparameter Impact Analysis
Perform an analysis on how each hyperparameter affects the performance of both CNN and RNN models (e.g., how varying learning rates or batch sizes affects accuracy).
